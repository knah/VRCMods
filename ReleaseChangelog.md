Read the [Malicious Mods and you](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/blob/master/Malicious-Mods.md) doc!

Changes:
 * LagFreeScreenshot: fixed for build 1203
 * ScaleGoesBrr: fixed issues with UI having weird scale if calibrating while scaled
 * ScaleGoesBrr: fixed head-follow calibration failing to follow the head vertically
 * IKTweaks: initial update for build 1203/IK 2.0
   * Removed all calibration-related options
   * You must use IK 2.0 for IKTweaks to work. It won't do anything for legacy IK.
   * Most mod features now work in 3/4-point tracking too
   * IKT spine solver now obeys lock modes. "Lock head" is same as old IKTweaks, "Lock both" is "Lock head but ignore angle limits"
   * Added an option to disable elbow-torso avoidance
   * Overall performance improvements
   * Fully open-source now - no FinalIK dependency anymore!
